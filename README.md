A simple UI tool to launch the My Health Record provider portal web site using a NASH Certificate.

This concept has been nicknamed FastPass within the Australian Digital Health Agency (ADHA).

The core idea is that a Clinical Information System (CIS) can integrate with FastPass to allow it
to launch the Provider Portal web site within context of the current patient in context of the CIS . 
This CIS would required a NASH certificate and a Healthcare professional's HPI-I identifier which 
has also been linked to the NASH certificate’s HPI-O in use.
